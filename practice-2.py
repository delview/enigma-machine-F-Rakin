# 1. Make a list called "messages" containing a series of short text messages. 

# Pass the list to a function called "show_messages()" which prints out each text message.

# Write a function called "send_messages()" that prints each text message and MOVES each message to a new list called "sent_messages" as it's printed. 

# After calling the function, print both of your lists to make sure the messages were moved correctly (there should be nothing left in the original list after it has been moved).
