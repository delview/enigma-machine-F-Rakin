# F.Rakin_Enigma_Machine

# Chosen cipher : Ceaser Cipher 

# Create a program that will start by asking the user whether they want to decrypt or encrypt a message.

# Accept a string that the program will either encrypt or decrypt. 

# Either call a function to encrypt or to decrypt the string.

# Create two functions that will accept parameters in the form of a list or a dictionary that will contain the string meant to be encrypted or decrypted. 

# One function will encrypt while the other will decrypt using the cipher technique you have chosen. 

# This should involve both loops and if statements.

# Present the final encrypted or decrypted string to the user. 

# The user must be able to copy that output and run it through the program again to perfectly encrypt or decrypt it multiple times without any mistakes
